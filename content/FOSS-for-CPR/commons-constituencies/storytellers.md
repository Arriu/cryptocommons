Bitcoin’s history is where we can learn most about these networks, because it has been running for longer and with higher stakes than any other blockchain project. Some people attribute much of Bitcoin’s rise in value to its growing [Lindy effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect) - whereby the longer it survives the longer it is expected to survive into the future. After 10 years of doing its thing with only minor interruptions, Bitcoin is establishing itself as a firm presence in the global economy. People are using it as intended, probably quite a few people. In Oct 2019 the IRS was [estimating](https://twitter.com/mrauchs/status/1184844394073079808?s=20) that 12 million Americans owed tax on cryptocurrency transactions or had assets they needed to declare.

What are people using Bitcoin for? That is hard to say, because people buy, hold and exchange Bitcoin for a variety of reasons and there is a lack of good data on what their motivations are. 

It is therefore the domain of storytellers, who are also responsible for distilling a highly technical construct (the blockchain) down into a relatable form that people can recognize and decide if they're interested in. 

For a minority of transactions (those associated with criminality) Bitcoin's resistance to seizure and censorship would be the critical features. Bitcoin was for some time portrayed as the "currency of the dark web", primarily used for illicit purposes. This is still quite an influential narrative, that it serves black/grey market purposes and is used for money laundering. Cash and digital fiat currency are also used for these purposes, cryptocurrency may have some advantages in this regard but the use of a public distributed ledger to record all transactions in perpetuity must surely count as a significant down-side. 

That narrative became less saleable when "respectable" institutions started to show an interest in Bitcoin. Here are some other plausible stories for why people buy and use Bitcoin:

* To use in transactions that are otherwise more expensive (e.g. cross-border payments).
* To use in transactions that one doesn't wish to be recorded by one's bank.
* As an alternative to holding a bank account.
* To circumvent [capital controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_control). 
* Lack of trust in local authorities to protect wealth stored in other ways.
* To hold for its fixed supply and ultimately deflationary economic properties, in the belief that it will be a good store of value.
* To hold in speculation that it will be worth more and can be sold at a higher price, as part of a short term trading strategy.
* To hold as an escape route or opt out of a local currency which has significant inflationary issues.
* For ideological reasons, believing a move to decentralized currencies to be in society's best interests.

The stories about why people use it define what it is for, and therefore narrative becomes an important component of governance on the crypto commons. If Bitcoin's rules are to change, that has to make sense to enough of its constituents to achieve a strong enough consensus to proceed.

The priority afforded to use as electronic cash, store of value, global reserve currency and tool for the oppressed determines one's view on how development should proceed, what the priorities are and which trade-offs are worth making. 

Narrative can also used as a weapon against cryptocurrencies by external actors who do not wish them to succeed. Nic Carter has a lot of great [commentary](https://medium.com/castle-island-ventures/how-to-critique-bitcoin-a-guide-3e36b26f9642) about the mainstream media's coverage of Bitcoin. I haven't been paying close attention, but it seems to have focused largely on price and the criminality angle, and it is rare to see an accurate description that alludes to its positive aspects.

Another popular narrative is that cryptocurrencies aren’t backed by anything. They are backed by the belief that they will be around in the future, still available to all and working as intended, reliably following the rules of their social contract.

The storytellers disseminate their versions of the narrative and social contract the way they see it. They buy into the story and understand that achieving their vision of cryptocurrency's place in the world depends on spreading the word to people who are unaware or ambivalent. Within the ecosystem, the same stories serve to bolster the cohesion of stakeholders around a shared version of the narrative and steer its governance accordingly.
