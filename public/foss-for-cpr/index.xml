      <description>A Common Pool Resource (CPR) is one which is naturally open for consumption (&amp;ldquo;size or characteristics make it difficult to exclude potential beneficiaries from obtaining benefits of use&amp;rdquo;) but which is subtractable (faces problems of congestion or overuse) - the latter point is the key differentiator to public goods.
The tragedy of the commons is a term popularized by Garrett Hardin - it refers to a scenario where an open resource is over-exploited because that is in the best interests of individual consumers, while they have no individual imperative to maintain or preserve the resource.</description>
