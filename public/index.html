<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This resource presents a view of blockchains and cryptocurrencies as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common-pool_resource">common pool resources</a>, and as products of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-based_peer_production">commons based peer production</a>. These concepts will be introduced, and their relevance to understanding blockchains ecosystems will be explored. I will present a view of cryptocurrencies as significant new forms of commons based peer production, that have in some cases managed to overcome the incentives/funding issue which often limits the scale of FOSS volunteer collectives and what they can produce.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a resilient social organism, native to the free digital commons. Participation in the Bitcoin network is open to all, the distributed ledger and software to read and interact with it are freely available and open source. The network is peer to peer, which gives it the same decentralized redundancy and resilience to shutdown as the Bittorrent protocol. For as long as people want to participate in Bitcoin and have a means to communicate, it is safe to assume that the network will be operating in at least some capacity. Given that the network is here to stay, and the people who embrace it have grand ambitions for its societal impact - it is important to understand the social and relational dynamics at play among participants, as these will determine how the network behaves in the long run.</p>

<p>The network is actively constructed by its human participants, who can be considered as a set of constituencies that each do their part to give the network and its native assets value. There are two key constituencies driving the network: the developers of the blockchain&rsquo;s software infrastructure, and the producers of blocks on the network (miners). I consider how those constituencies interact with each other, and the other constituencies that contribute to giving the network value (merchants, service providers, node operators, users).</p>

<p>The work of Elinor Ostrom will be used to consider the resources these networks produce as <strong>common pool resources</strong>. Blockchains are in a sense public goods, because they are accessible to all, but the resource they produce (incorruptible public ledger open to all, providing capacity to make uncensorable transactions) is necessarily finite (because scale comes at a cost to nodes in the network).</p>

<p>The work of Yochai Benkler will be used to consider the production of these resources as a form of <strong>commons based peer production</strong>, and the software they run on will be considered as examples of Free Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS). My position is that blockchain projects are significant as new forms of commons based peer production which incentivize the production effort much more effectively than prior forms. Blockchains therefore have the potential to harness the power of commons based peer production at greater scale and be of greater consequence to wider society.</p>

<p>The blockchain itself is a new form of digital commons where the rules are enforced collectively by all participants. We are witnessing a flurry of experimentation in how the novel affordances of this decentralized commons can be used to facilitate new modes of organization and coordination.</p>

<p>The first part of this resource introduces the concepts and considers what is familiar and what is different about the cryptocurrency context. A framework is developed which involves profiling the constituencies that make up a blockchain&rsquo;s ecosystem and considering the roles they play and how they interact with each other.</p>

<p>In part 2 of the resource this framework is then applied to characterize a number of projects based on observations of their commons.  This is composed of a set of reviews of blockchain type projects from the perspective of common pool resources and commons based peer production.</p>

<p>Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) have emerged as an effort to harness the coordination and organizational affordances of blockchains. I will consider some examples of DAOs that are being used as part of the governance of cryptocurrency networks, and also some platforms which exist to allow for the creation of DAOs with varied purposes.</p>

<p>This is version 0.5.0 - I consider this a not quite public beta, the purpose of which is to collect feedback which can be used to improve the resource before launching it properly.</p>

<p>I am planning to develop this resource on an ongoing basis, and will collect updates into releases with release notes that explain what has changed - you can follow the full history of how it develops in the GitHub repository, and check the diff to see what has changed since the last version you read.</p>

<p>This resource is closely related to the <a href="https://github.com/RichardRed0x/crypto-governance-research">crypto governance research</a> repository, which collects answers to a standardized set of questions for a variety of projects. That repository is open for contributions. A good reason to try and open this up is that there is simply too much going on in the space for one or a small number of contributors to track.</p>
